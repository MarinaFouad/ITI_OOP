Assignment 8
Make a class called Complex which describes the complex numbers (int real, int Imaginary), 
then(using 
operator overloading): 
*make it simple and just add the real to the real and, add the imaginary to the imaginary*  
 
1. c3 = c1 - c2 
2. c3 = 7 - c2  
3. c3 = c2 - 7 
4. c1 -= c2  
5. -c1 
6. c1 == c2 
7. c1 != c2 
8. c1 > c2, c1 >= c2 
9. c < c2, c1 <= c2 
10. (int) c1 (case Implicitly) 
11. (string) c1 (Cast Explicitly) 
12. If (c1); // Cast bool
